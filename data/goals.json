This is a new APG that supports the President’s BIL goal of installing 500,000 EV chargers.\r\n\r\nBy September 30, 2023, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation in conjunction with DOT and DOE will complete the following critical building blocks needed for the deployment of EV charging infrastructure by:\r\n- Issuing a set of minimum standards and requirements for all EV chargers deployed under the BIL programs to ensure an affordable, reliable, accessible, and equitable EV charging network\r\n- Facilitating the development and approval of State, Puerto Rico, and District of Columbia EV charging plans to establish a cohesive national EV charging network that covers all Interstates and designated highway corridors\r\n- Distributing formula funds “National EV Infrastructure Formula Program” and awarding competitive grants under the Discretionary Grant Program for Charging and Fueling Infrastructure to eligible entities following the timeline specified in the BIL\r\n- Launching a federal EV Advisory Committee\r\n- Offering technical assistance to school districts and transit operators deploying electric school and transit buses under BIL programs.",
